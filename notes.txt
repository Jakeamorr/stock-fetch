PURPOSE:

StockFetch is a pseudo wrapper API for the IEX Cloud API whose main purpose
is to deliver a more simplified interface.

While the IEX Cloud API offers a multitude of endpoints and information, all we really care about is tracking
some basic information about a group of stocks that we select.
